# chriswmann.me
A data science portfolio website.

## Welcome
chriswmann.me will be a website to showcase my data science and machine learning engineering skills in an end-to-end, productionised context.

It is a new project (as of 23rd June 2019) and one I'm creating in my spare time.

I'm yet to make various decisions but have so far decided to:
1. Use python (instead of R). I'm experienced with both python and R for data science.  However, I don't know any web frameworks in R, whereas I have made and deployed several websites with Django, postgresql, gunicorn and nginx previously.
2. Dockerise the project for development and deployment.  This is my preferred approach for a project of this type, both from an environment and deployment perspective.
3. Base the analysis on a data source which will be regularly updated, to demonstrate model update and maintenance.
4. Include unit and integration tests using pytest.
5. Focus on the modelling, visualisation and productionisation rather than front end design.
